# SHOPPING-CART-OOP
This project is a simple OOP based shopping cart built with JavaScript. It includes classes for products, cart items, and the shopping cart itself allowing you to add items, remove them, calculate totals, and display the cart. A straightforward example of applying core OOP principles in a practical, real-world scenario.
